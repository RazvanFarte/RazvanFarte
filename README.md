### Hey guys ðŸ‘‹

Probably my name, Razvan, is difficult to pronounce for some of you, but you can call me Ras. Shorter, easier, better.

I've not used GitHub at it's full capacity, but in 2020 I made a change and now I'm more active on the platform than ever before. I worked in companies, on propretary software hosted on GitHub, but that was private and now I feel hollow without my contribution on those repositories. Anyhow, this year I forked, commented, read and kept in contact with the community a lot.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on ShortPixel Repository and other WP related open source projects, but not only that.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on sincerly anything. If I like the idea, I'll colaborate. I found a repository with an APK for Pokemon Pokedex and I like the UX of the app. I am decided to try that out later these days
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with PHP, Java, NGOs, open source projects
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about mountains, meditation, productivity
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: please get in contact with me on [my LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/razvanfarte/). Not only we could add each other into our networks, but we could endourse the skills and keep a professional relationship. I check my LIn daily, so I'll make sure to answer.
